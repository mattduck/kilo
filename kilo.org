* Kilo

This is my implementation of the Kilo text editor, written by following [[https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html][Build
your own text editor]]. It's written as an org-mode file, as an exercise for me to
learn a bit more about C, building terminal applications, and literate
programming with org-mode.


* Compilation

This just concatenates all the C snippets to ~kilo.c~, and then runs ~make~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
    (defun md/kilo-compile ()
      (interactive)
      (setq-local org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
      (org-babel-tangle nil "kilo.c" "c")
      (compile "make"))
    (md/kilo-compile)
#+end_src


* Main

#+begin_src c
  int main() {
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src
